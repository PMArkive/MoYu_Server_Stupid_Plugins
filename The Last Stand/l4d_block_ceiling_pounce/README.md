# Block Ceiling Pounce

### Introduction
- Block infinite ceiling pounces.
	- You can still do ceiling pounce for **1 time**.
- Some whatever reasons:
	- It looks pretty abused recently.
	- Personally I really hate ceiling hunters get fking silent around until they smash me in a sudden.
	- It's a __skill__ as bad as back jumps.
